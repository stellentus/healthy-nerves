# Healthy Nerves

This Matlab code was written for my thesis research. This work eventually led to the [Nerve Norms](https://nervenorms.bellstone.ca) website, a clinical tool to allow health care workers to measure the health of peripheral nerves. The [Nerve Norms repository](https://github.com/stellentus/nerve-norms) is also on GitHub.

The files in the top level of the project are mostly entry points, while the directories contain supporting code. Some files were used to run simulations for posters or papers, while other files compiled figures for publications.
